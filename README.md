The same message appears in 3.1 when you try to do something like that. Now, I'm not sure if it's accessible still, since 64bit Windows can't run old 16bit apps, but I'd bet you it's still in there in the code. And there are probably more," [quote Luka Marinov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GBs1GapIvw&lc=Ugy8YsWgdN2k0wMzbrp4AaABAg.9ape1HPKQJQ9arO2C_HrVA) ❌

[quote Rizki Fauzan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GBs1GapIvw&lc=UgzdN2YOtPOjjpkb1eR4AaABAg) (not counting this as a Windows 1.0 remnant because it was still useful in 3.1) ❌

**Score: 0/7**

## Windows 1.0 Remnants
1) "Move" Function When Right-Clicking on Window Bar - unchanged since Windows 1.0 (lack of updates can be shown by lack of aero snap support) ❌

**Score: 0/1**

## Overall Score: 11/76
The fact that there are still remnants that go all the way back to Windows 3.1 is baffling. It's crazy how lazy Microsoft has gotten when it comes to updating these features. It seems like the older they get, the less likely Microsoft is to actually update them. I have my doubts that the Windows 3.1 remnants will ever receive an update. If Microsoft dedicated an entire feature update to fixing these ancient elements of their bloated operating system, I would be extremely happy as it's long overdue. They're clearly leaving these so people just get used to them and forget that they were ever outdated.
